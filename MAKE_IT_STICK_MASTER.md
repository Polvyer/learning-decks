# Make It Stick (Anki Source Notes)

A curated set of durable learning principles worth turning into Anki cards.  
Metadata is included here only for organization.  
Your Anki cards should not include chapter or subheading labels.

--------------------------------------------------------

## Chapter 1 — Learning Is Misunderstood

  #### Card 1 — Why is the “learning styles” idea (visual, auditory, etc.) a myth?

  Because studies don’t show better learning when teaching matches a preferred style; people learn better when they learn the same thing in a few different ways (not just one).

  #### Card 2 — Why is knowledge a necessary foundation for creativity and higher-level thinking?

  Because you can’t think creatively or solve problems without something to build on. You need stored knowledge first, or there’s nothing to use, combine, or think with.

  #### Card 3 — Rereading often feels like learning, but testing often feels harder. Explain why rereading can mislead you about mastery, what testing reveals that it can’t, and what habit you should use because of that.

  Rereading creates familiarity that can mimic mastery even if you can’t recall the material from memory. Testing forces you to try to recall it, which shows what you know and don’t know yet (your gaps). So your default habit should be regular self-quizzing.

## Chapter 2 — To Learn, Retrieve

 ### Reflection Is a Form of Practice

  #### Card 4 — How does reflection strengthen learning beyond what you got from the first time you learned or did something?

  Because reflection makes you retrieve the experience, connect it to what you already know, analyze what worked or didn’t, and think through how to improve next time — adding new insight beyond the original moment.

 ### The Testing Effect

  #### Card 5 — Why does spaced, effortful retrieval strengthen memory more than rereading?

  Because spaced, effortful recall makes your brain rebuild the memory each time, which makes it much stronger and easier to access later. Rereading doesn’t force that rebuilding process.

 ### Studying the Testing Effect in the Lab

  #### Card 6 - What effect does taking a test have on forgetting?

  Because taking a test slows or nearly stops forgetting — retrieval stabilizes memory so later forgetting drops sharply.

 ### Studying the Testing Effect “In the Wild”

  #### Card 7 - What key difference did research show between reexposure and retrieval?

  Reexposure gives short-term performance boosts, but only retrieval creates long-term retention.

 ### Exploring Nuances
  
  #### Card 8 - What two unexpected learning benefits did research find that retrieval provides beyond remembering the material itself?

  Retrieval boosts transfer (using the knowledge in new contexts) and strengthens access to related information you were never tested on.

  #### Card 9 — Why does delayed feedback usually strengthen learning more than immediate feedback?

  Because delayed feedback makes you attempt retrieval first, then correct it afterward — giving you effortful practice and spaced reinforcement. Immediate (during-the-attempt) feedback interrupts retrieval and creates dependence on constant cues.

  #### Card 10 - What are the indirect classroom benefits of frequent low-stakes testing?

  It increases attendance, boosts studying before class, improves attentiveness, reduces test anxiety, helps students calibrate what they know, and helps instructors identify learning gaps.

  #### Card 11 - Which types of retrieval produce the strongest long-term learning, and why?

  Retrieval that requires you to supply the answer (free recall, short answer, flashcards) produces the strongest learning because it demands more cognitive effort. Recognition-based tests (multiple choice, true/false) provide cues and require less effort, so learning is weaker.

 ### The Takeaway

  #### Card 12 - Why does spacing retrieval (including delaying a re-test) strengthen learning more than massed or immediate retrieval?

  Because spacing allows forgetting, which makes retrieval effortful, and effortful retrieval strengthens memory far more than easy recall.

  #### Card 13 - Why does repeated retrieval help you apply knowledge in new contexts?

  Because it builds multiple retrieval pathways.

  #### Card 14 - Why is corrective feedback necessary after retrieval?

  Because retrieval can reinforce wrong answers; feedback corrects mistakes before they become learned.

## Chapter 3 — Mix Up Your Practice

 ### The Myth of Massed Practice

  #### Card 21 - WWhy do humans keep choosing massed practice even when it doesn’t work?

  Because massed practice produces rapid, visible performance gains, which feel like learning, but those gains rely on short-term memory and fade quickly, hiding the rapid forgetting that follows.

  #### Card 22 - What tradeoff does spaced practice make compared to massed practice?

  Spaced practice sacrifices fast, easy improvements in exchange for slower progress that produces longer retention, better mastery, and greater versatility.
