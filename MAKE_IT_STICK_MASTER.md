# Make It Stick (Anki Source Notes)

A curated set of durable learning principles worth turning into Anki cards.  
Metadata is included here only for organization.  
Your Anki cards should not include chapter or subheading labels.

--------------------------------------------------------

## Chapter 1 — Learning Is Misunderstood

  #### C01-01 — Why is the “learning styles” idea (visual, auditory, etc.) a myth?

  Because studies don’t show better learning when teaching matches a preferred style; people learn better when they learn the same thing in a few different ways (not just one).

  #### C01-02 — Why is knowledge a necessary foundation for creativity and higher-level thinking?

  Because you can’t think creatively or solve problems without something to build on. You need stored knowledge first, or there’s nothing to use, combine, or think with.

  #### C01-03 — Rereading often feels like learning, but testing often feels harder. Explain why rereading can mislead you about mastery, what testing reveals that it can’t, and what habit you should use because of that.

  Rereading creates familiarity that can mimic mastery even if you can’t recall the material. Testing forces you to try to recall it, which shows what you know and don’t know yet (your gaps). So your default habit should be regular self-quizzing.

## Chapter 2 — To Learn, Retrieve

  #### C02-01 — How does reflection strengthen learning beyond what you got from the first time you learned or did something?

  Because reflection makes you retrieve the experience, connect it to what you already know, analyze what worked or didn’t, and think through how to improve next time — adding new insight beyond the original moment.
  
  #### C02-02 - What two unexpected learning benefits did research find that retrieval provides beyond remembering the material itself?

  Retrieval boosts transfer (using the knowledge in new contexts) and strengthens access to related information you were never tested on.

  #### C02-03 - Which types of retrieval produce the strongest long-term learning, and why?

  Retrieval that requires you to supply the answer (free recall, short answer, flashcards) produces the strongest learning because it demands more cognitive effort. Recognition-based tests (multiple choice, true/false) provide cues and require less effort, so learning is weaker.

  #### C02-04 - Why does spacing retrieval (including delaying a re-test) strengthen learning more than massed or immediate retrieval?

  Because spacing allows forgetting, which makes retrieval effortful, and effortful retrieval strengthens memory far more than easy recall.

  #### C02-05 - Why does repeated retrieval help you apply knowledge in new contexts?

  Because it builds multiple retrieval pathways to the same knowledge.

  #### C02-06 - The book says retrieval “consolidates” memory. What does that mean, what happens to forgetting afterward, and what kind of gains does rereading/reexposure tend to give you instead?

  Consolidation means retrieval rebuilds and stabilizes the memory, so later forgetting slows sharply. Rereading/reexposure mainly gives short-term performance gains, not long-term retention.

  #### C02-07 - Why is feedback most useful after an attempt at retrieval, and why must it be corrective?

  Trying first preserves effortful retrieval; corrective feedback then fixes errors so you don’t reinforce the wrong answer.

## Chapter 3 — Mix Up Your Practice

  #### C03-01 - What’s the problem with massed practice, and what three features make practice more effective?

  Massed practice shows fast improvement, but rapid forgetting comes later and is easy to miss. Practice works better when it’s spaced, interleaved, and varied—it feels harder, but it produces better mastery, retention, and versatility/transfer.

  #### C03-02 - Why does spaced practice work better than massed practice at the level of consolidation (two reasons)?

  Spaced practice works better because consolidation unfolds over hours to days (durable learning needs time). Rapid-fire practice leans on short-term memory, whereas retrieving after a little forgetting requires more effort, retriggers consolidation, and further strengthens memory.

  #### C03-03 - Interleaving hurts what during practice, and forces you to do what on each problem?

  Interleaving mixes problem types/procedures, which slows and confuses learning during practice, but forces you to discriminate/choose the right method instead of going on autopilot.

  #### C03-04 - Why does varied practice transfer better to new situations?

  Because you practice the same skill in different setups, so you learn how to adjust instead of memorizing one exact version.

  #### C03-05 - In real life/exams, problems are mixed. What skill do interleaving + varied practice train that massed practice doesn’t?

  Discrimination: getting good at deciding ‘what kind of problem is this?’ so you can pick the right solution instead of assuming it’s the same one as the last rep.

  #### C03-06 - Why does practicing on real or simulated patients improve performance more than reading about procedures?

  Because retrieval practice is most effective when it matches how the knowledge will be used later; book learning alone is not enough.

  #### C03-07 - Why isn’t solving harder and harder problems enough to maintain performance?

  Because fundamentals decay without maintenance; you must keep practicing them from time to time, forever.

  #### C03-08 - When full practice isn’t possible, what kind of rehearsal can still strengthen performance?

  Mentally rehearse the steps and possible adjustments to simulate what might happen.

  #### C03-09 - How long should you wait between practice sessions?

  Long enough that it’s not mindless repetition—at least enough for a little forgetting—but not so long that retrieval becomes relearning.

  #### C03-10 - In interleaving, when do you switch topics/skills?

  Before each practice set is complete—you don’t finish one topic then move to another.

  #### C03-11 - Why do you need to shuffle your flashcards?

  If you always practice in the same order, it’s like an old LP that plays songs in the same sequence—practice becomes predictable and starves learning of real variety.
