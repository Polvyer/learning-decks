Your Anki cards should not include chapter or subheading labels.

## Chapter 1 — Learning Is Misunderstood

--------------------------------------------------------

### Claims We Make in This Book

#### Card 1 — Why is the “learning styles” idea (visual, auditory, etc.) a myth?

Because research shows people don’t learn better when instruction matches a preferred style; learning improves more by using multiple forms of intelligence and going wide with varied methods.

--------------------------------------------------------

### People Misunderstand Learning

#### Card 2 — Why doesn’t repetition alone produce durable learning?

Because it doesn’t require effortful retrieval — without retrieval, the memory trace doesn’t strengthen, so it fades quickly.

--------------------------------------------------------

### Illusions of Knowing

#### Card 3 — Why does rereading feel productive even though it isn’t?

Because rereading increases fluency (familiarity), and fluency creates a false sense of mastery even when you can’t actually recall or use the ideas.

--------------------------------------------------------

### Knowledge: Not Sufficient, but Necessary

#### Card 4 — Why is knowledge a necessary foundation for creativity and higher-level thinking?

Because you can’t think creatively or solve problems without something to build on. You need stored knowledge first, or there’s nothing to use, combine, or think with.

--------------------------------------------------------

### Knowledge: Testing: Dipstick versus Learning Tool

#### Card 5 — Why is testing (retrieval) more effective for learning than rereading or review?

Because retrieval strengthens memory and interrupts forgetting, and it shows you what you know and don’t know. Rereading only makes things feel familiar without building lasting memory.

--------------------------------------------------------

### Knowledge: The Takeaway

#### Card 6 — What is one of the most important habits learners should use to avoid illusions of knowing and learn more effectively?

Regular self-quizzing — using retrieval to check what you actually know and what you don’t.
