## Chapter 1 — Learning Is Misunderstood

  #### C01-01 — Why is the “learning styles” idea (visual, auditory, etc.) a myth?

  Because studies don’t show better learning when teaching matches a preferred style; people learn better when they learn the same thing in a few different ways (not just one).

  #### C01-02 — Why is knowledge a necessary foundation for creativity and higher-level thinking?

  Because you can’t think creatively or solve problems without something to build on. You need stored knowledge first, or there’s nothing to use, combine, or think with.

  #### C01-03 — Rereading often feels like learning, but testing often feels harder. Explain why rereading can mislead you about mastery, what testing reveals that it can’t, and what habit you should use because of that.

  Rereading creates familiarity that can mimic mastery even if you can’t recall the material. Testing forces you to try to recall it, which shows what you know and don’t know yet (your gaps). So your default habit should be regular self-quizzing.

## Chapter 2 — To Learn, Retrieve

  #### C02-01 — How does reflection strengthen learning beyond what you got from the first time you learned or did something?

  Because reflection makes you retrieve the experience, connect it to what you already know, analyze what worked or didn’t, and think through how to improve next time — adding new insight beyond the original moment.
  
  #### C02-02 - What two unexpected learning benefits did research find that retrieval provides beyond remembering the material itself?

  Retrieval boosts transfer (using the knowledge in new contexts) and strengthens access to related information you were never tested on.

  #### C02-03 - Which types of retrieval produce the strongest long-term learning, and why?

  Retrieval that requires you to supply the answer (free recall, short answer, flashcards) produces the strongest learning because it demands more cognitive effort. Recognition-based tests (multiple choice, true/false) provide cues and require less effort, so learning is weaker.

  #### C02-04 - Why does spacing retrieval (including delaying a re-test) strengthen learning more than massed or immediate retrieval?

  Because spacing allows forgetting, which makes retrieval effortful, and effortful retrieval strengthens memory far more than easy recall.

  #### C02-05 - Why does repeated retrieval help you apply knowledge in new contexts?

  Because it builds multiple retrieval pathways to the same knowledge.

  #### C02-06 - The book says retrieval “consolidates” memory. What does that mean, what happens to forgetting afterward, and what kind of gains does rereading/reexposure tend to give you instead?

  Consolidation means retrieval rebuilds and stabilizes the memory, so later forgetting slows sharply. Rereading/reexposure mainly gives short-term performance gains, not long-term retention.

  #### C02-07 - Why is feedback most useful after an attempt at retrieval, and why must it be corrective?

  Trying first preserves effortful retrieval; corrective feedback then fixes errors so you don’t reinforce the wrong answer.

## Chapter 3 — Mix Up Your Practice

  #### C03-01 - What’s the problem with massed practice, and what three features make practice more effective?

  Massed practice shows fast improvement, but rapid forgetting comes later and is easy to miss. Practice works better when it’s spaced, interleaved, and varied—it feels harder, but it produces better mastery, retention, and versatility/transfer.

  #### C03-02 - Why does spaced practice work better than massed practice at the level of consolidation (two reasons)?

  Spaced practice works better because consolidation unfolds over hours to days (durable learning needs time). Rapid-fire practice leans on short-term memory, whereas retrieving after a little forgetting requires more effort, retriggers consolidation, and further strengthens memory.

  #### C03-03 - Interleaving hurts what during practice, and forces you to do what on each problem?

  Interleaving mixes problem types/procedures, which slows and confuses learning during practice, but forces you to discriminate/choose the right method instead of going on autopilot.

  #### C03-04 - Why does varied practice transfer better to new situations?

  Because you practice the same skill in different setups, so you learn how to adjust instead of memorizing one exact version.

  #### C03-05 - In real life/exams, problems are mixed. What skill do interleaving + varied practice train that massed practice doesn’t?

  Discrimination: getting good at deciding ‘what kind of problem is this?’ so you can pick the right solution instead of assuming it’s the same one as the last rep.

  #### C03-06 - Why does practicing on real or simulated patients improve performance more than reading about procedures?

  Because retrieval practice is most effective when it matches how the knowledge will be used later; book learning alone is not enough.

  #### C03-07 - Why isn’t solving harder and harder problems enough to maintain performance?

  Because fundamentals decay without maintenance; you must keep practicing them from time to time, forever.

  #### C03-08 - When full practice isn’t possible, what kind of rehearsal can still strengthen performance?

  Mentally rehearse the steps and possible adjustments to simulate what might happen.

  #### C03-09 - How long should you wait between practice sessions?

  Long enough that it’s not mindless repetition—at least enough for a little forgetting—but not so long that retrieval becomes relearning.

  #### C03-10 - In interleaving, when do you switch topics/skills?

  Before each practice set is complete—you don’t finish one topic then move to another.

  #### C03-11 - Why do you need to shuffle your flashcards?

  If you always practice in the same order, it’s like an old LP that plays songs in the same sequence—practice becomes predictable and starves learning of real variety.

## Chapter 4 — Embrace Difficulties

  #### C04-01 — What does it mean that “testing is the principal instructional medium”?

  The “lesson” is structured around performance attempts—“the test is in the doing”—rather than note-taking.

  #### C04-02 — Why can someone “know” something yet fail to produce it on demand?

  Because the knowledge may be securely anchored in long-term memory but not sufficiently associated with diverse retrieval cues, so it isn’t accessible in the current context (anchored ≠ accessible).

  #### C04-03 — What is reconsolidation?

  Reconsolidation is the process by which retrieving a memory from long-term storage makes it modifiable again while strengthening it, allowing it to connect to more recent learning.

  #### C04-04 — What three factors determine how readily you can recall knowledge from your “internal archives”?

  Context, recent use, and the number + vividness of cues linked to the knowledge.

  #### C04-05 — What’s the “paradox” of forgetting in learning?

  Some forgetting (of older competing cues/habits) is often essential for new learning to take hold reliably.

  #### C04-06 — When you “forget” something you once knew well, what is often actually forgotten—and what does recognition show?

  Often it’s the retrieval cues/access that fade or get reassigned, not the knowledge itself; recognition (e.g., multiple choice) can show the memory trace still exists even when free recall fails.

  #### C04-07 - What three characteristics make knowledge “deeply entrenched” and therefore more durable?
  
  1. Firm, thorough comprehension of the concept
  2. Practical importance or keen emotional weight in your life
  3. Connected to other knowledge you hold in memory

  #### C04-08 — What is the paradox at the heart of “desirable difficulties” in learning?

  That retrieval which requires greater effort—often because knowledge has been partially forgotten—more strongly entrenches and shapes permanent learning than retrieval that feels easy.

  #### C04-09 — During focused, effortful recall, what six things does reconsolidation do to the learning?

  It makes the learning changeable again; the most important aspects become clearer; reconsolidation reinforces meaning, strengthens connections to prior knowledge, improves cues and retrieval routes for recalling it later, and weakens competing routes.

  #### C04-10 — Under what condition does increasing the effort of recall or execution improve learning?

  Only when the effort succeeds; greater effort then produces greater learning benefits.
  
  #### C04-11 — What are mental models, and how are they created?

  Mental models are highly efficient skills or knowledge structures formed when effortful practice fuses complex ideas or motor skills into a meaningful whole, so you can use them in many different situations.

  #### C04-12 — In Make It Stick, what is fluency, and why is it an unreliable signal of durable learning?

  Fluency is the feeling of ease/familiarity with a text—how lucid and effortless it seems as you read (especially after rereading). It’s unreliable because fluency illusions make us mistake fluency with a text for mastery of its content, so we overestimate our accessible knowledge and how well we’ll perform later.

  #### C04-13 — What kind of desirable difficulty works by disrupting fluency, why does it work, and when does it stop helping?

  Difficulties that disrupt fluency—like slightly out-of-focus text, harder-to-decipher fonts, omitting letters so you must supply them, or a lecture outline that doesn’t match the textbook order—can improve learning because the disruption forces you to work harder to construct an interpretation that makes sense. That added effort to construct meaning increases comprehension and learning as long as meaning remains recoverable. When the disruption obscures meaning or cannot be overcome, it stops being desirable and learning does not improve.

  #### C04-14 — When the material is already familiar, what minimal “generation” manipulation still boosts later recall?

  Being required to supply the answer (e.g., filling in a blank) rather than being presented with it or simply recognizing it.

  #### C04-15 — When you generate on something you don’t yet know (new material), why can even an incorrect attempt improve learning once the correct answer is provided?

  Because when you cast about for an answer, you retrieve related knowledge from memory and, in doing so, strengthen the route from the question cue to the relevant knowledge network, even before the correct answer is given. Then, when the answer is supplied, that related material is already active, so the new information connects to it and is encoded more deeply than it would be from simply reading the answer (e.g., guessing Dallas? Houston? before learning that Austin is the capital of Texas).

  #### C04-16 — In Make It Stick, distinguish retrieval, generation, elaboration, and reflection—what is each one doing (core operation), how do they relate, and give one example prompt of each.

  Retrieval: bringing learned knowledge to mind (recalling it from memory).

    Example prompt: “Without looking, what are the key ideas from today’s reading?”

  Generation: trying to answer or solve—producing an answer/solution rather than being presented with it (including filling in a blank).

    Example prompt: “Before you check the solution, what do you think the answer is?”

  Elaboration: giving learning meaning by expressing it in your own words and connecting it to what you already know—explaining how the new learning relates to prior knowledge (often with causes, examples, or relationships).

    Example prompt: “In my own words, how does this idea connect to something I already know—what’s a concrete example?”

  Reflection: taking a few minutes to review what was learned and ask yourself questions; reflection can involve retrieval (bring it to mind), elaboration (connect it to what you know), and generation (rephrase/mentally rehearse improvements).

    Example prompt (template): “(Retrieval) What are the key ideas / what happened? (Elaboration) What are some examples and how does this relate to what I already know? (Generation) How would I rephrase it or what would I do differently next time?”
