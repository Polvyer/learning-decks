# Make It Stick — Core Concepts (Anki Source Notes)

A curated set of durable learning principles worth turning into Anki cards.  
Metadata is included here only for organization.  
Your Anki cards should not include chapter or subheading labels.

--------------------------------------------------------

## Chapter 1 — Learning Is Misunderstood

 ### Claims We Make in This Book

  #### Card 1 — Why is the “learning styles” idea (visual, auditory, etc.) a myth?

  Because research shows people don’t learn better when instruction matches a preferred style; learning improves more by using multiple forms of intelligence and going wide with varied methods.

 ### People Misunderstand Learning

  #### Card 2 — Why doesn’t repetition alone produce durable learning?

  Because just running over the same material doesn’t make your brain work to bring it back on its own, so the memory stays weak and fades quickly.

 ### Illusions of Knowing

  #### Card 3 — Why does rereading feel productive even though it isn’t?

  Because rereading increases fluency (familiarity), and fluency creates a false sense of mastery even when you can’t actually recall or use the ideas.

 ### Knowledge: Not Sufficient, but Necessary

  #### Card 4 — Why is knowledge a necessary foundation for creativity and higher-level thinking?

  Because you can’t think creatively or solve problems without something to build on. You need stored knowledge first, or there’s nothing to use, combine, or think with.

 ### Knowledge: Testing: Dipstick versus Learning Tool

  #### Card 5 — Why is testing more effective for learning than rereading or review?

  Because testing strengthens memory and interrupts forgetting, and it shows you what you know and don’t know. Rereading only makes things feel familiar without building lasting memory.

  #### Card 6 — Why do students avoid or undervalue testing?

  Because they think tests only judge their performance or worth, so they see testing as stressful evaluation instead of a learning tool — and don’t realize retrieval makes learning stick.

 ### Knowledge: The Takeaway

  #### Card 7 — What is one of the most important habits learners should use to avoid illusions of knowing and learn more effectively?

  Regular self-quizzing — using retrieval to check what you actually know and what you don’t.

## Chapter 2 — To Learn, Retrieve

 ### Reflection Is a Form of Practice

  #### Card 8 — How does reflection strengthen learning beyond what you got from the first time you learned or did something?

  Because reflection makes you retrieve the experience, connect it to what you already know, analyze what worked or didn’t, and think through how to improve next time — adding new insight beyond the original moment.

 ### The Testing Effect

  #### Card 9 — What is the testing effect?

  The testing effect is the finding that actively retrieving information makes learning stick far better than simply restudying it.

  #### Card 10 — Why does spaced, effortful retrieval strengthen memory more than rereading?

  Because spaced, effortful recall makes your brain rebuild the memory each time, which makes it much stronger and easier to access later. Rereading doesn’t force that rebuilding process.

  #### Card 11 — Why do people misunderstand the testing effect?

  Because they think testing only measures learning instead of realizing that the act of recalling is what actually creates the learning.
